# anything-you-can-do
This project is a code rafactoring assignment issued by the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp.
I read through the code at first, and discovered the code was hard to read. I edited the code's placement so that it looks less cluttered and more appealing to read.
I learned that easy-to-read code is important for eye health and the "sanity" of the coder or programmer.

SCREENSHOTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE CODE
